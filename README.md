## Project Overview 📋

This repository houses my **push_swap** project, a complex algorithmic challenge designed to sort stacks using a pre-defined set of operations efficiently. This project served as a personal deep dive into algorithmic complexity and C programming, with a keen focus on creating a sorting algorithm that’s not just correct, but optimized for performance.

-**Double Stack Manipulation 🔄:** Utilizing two stacks, a and b, the exercise involves sorting a random series of numbers in ascending order on stack a, employing only the allowed operations.

-**Operations Set 🛠️:** The allowed operations, such as sa, pa, rra, etc., offer a limited yet powerful toolkit for manipulating stack contents.

-**Optimization Challenge 🚀:** The core of the project is to transform an unsorted stack into a sorted one using the fewest possible operations, showcasing my grasp of algorithmic efficiency.

## Technical Execution 🔧

-**Coding Standards 📜:** Adherence to the Norm coding standards is a guarantee, ensuring clean and readable C code throughout the project.

-**Robust Error Handling ⚠️:** Every questionable scenario is met with clear error messaging, preventing undefined behaviors and protecting against common issues like segmentation faults.

-**Memory Management 🧠:** Dynamic memory allocation is handled meticulously, with every byte of heap memory being accounted for and freed appropriately to avoid leaks.


## Algorithmic Strategy 🧩

-**Longest Sorted Subsequence Approach 📈:** My implementation leverages the concept of finding the longest sorted subsequence within the unsorted stack to minimize operations required for full stack sorting.


## Project Conclusion 🎓
The “push_swap” project is a testament to my capabilities in computational thinking and coding discipline. Coincidentally, it serves as a comprehensive example of advanced C programming and sorting algorithms, crucial for both academic understanding and technical interviews. 🚀👩‍💻
